Install required python packages:  
```
pip install cryptography
python -m pip install mysql-connector-python
```  
To init database run some mysql database server and specify data in config.ini file.   
We use mysql local database server provided by Laragon environment. You can choose what you want.  
Default settings for config.ini are shown below.     
```
[db]
db_host = localhost
db_username = root
db_password = 
```

Next run in project root folder:  
```
py database/InitDB.py
```
This will create database called usmtp and seed data with example users.


Last step is running: (Remember to have running mysql database because script after running try to connect to db)

```
py server.py
```
And
```
py client.py
```
To init server and client communication
